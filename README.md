 1. COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Over Time
   - Line Charts Display the evolution of COVID-19 cases and deaths monthly across different regions and years (2020-2022).
   - Spikes and declines in cases and deaths are highlighted, with notable surges during specific months.
   - **Regions Tracked WHO regions such as AFRO (Africa), AMRO (Americas), EURO (Europe), etc.

 2. Weekly Trends
   - New Cases and Deaths by Week**: Bar charts show the sum of new cases and deaths weekly.
   - Highlights significant peaks, like the rapid increase during pandemic waves.

 3. Country-Wise Cases
   - A breakdown of COVID-19 cases by country, indicating which countries had the highest case counts:
     - Example: The United States, India, and Brazil are among the top contributors.
   - Proportions are given as percentages of the total global cases.

 4. Cumulative Data by WHO Region

   - Stacked Bar Chart Represents cumulative cases across WHO regions.
   - Regions like AMRO (Americas) and EURO (Europe) show higher case totals compared to others.

 5. Hierarchy Analysis
   - Drills down into the hierarchy of regions and countries to identify which areas were most affected.
   - For instance, SEARO (Southeast Asia) data indicates India as the largest contributor in the region.

 6. Patterns and Trends
   - Charts emphasize spikes and declines in cases and deaths.
   - Visualization of moving averages helps smooth out daily/weekly fluctuations to show long-term trends.

 7. Interactive Filters
   - Users can filter data by month, year, region, or country.
   - This interactivity allows for in-depth analysis of specific periods or areas.

 Key Insights
- Regions and countries were impacted differently, with clear visual differentiation.
- Temporal analysis provides insights into how cases and deaths evolved during key phases of the pandemic.
- High variability in case and death trends reflects the impact of interventions like lockdowns and vaccinations.
